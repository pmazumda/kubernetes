1.   What is the role of an SRE in managing Kubernetes clusters?

Answer: SREs are responsible for the reliability, availability, and performance of Kubernetes clusters. They ensure smooth operations, monitor performance metrics, troubleshoot issues, and implement best practices for efficient resource utilization and scaling.

2.  How do you handle Kubernetes cluster upgrades to minimize downtime?

Answer: SREs typically perform rolling upgrades by updating one node at a time, ensuring the cluster maintains the desired number of replicas during the upgrade process. They monitor the progress and rollback if issues arise.

3.  Describe how you would set up effective monitoring and alerting for a Kubernetes cluster.

Answer: SREs set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to collect metrics from the cluster components and applications. They define alerting rules based on critical metrics and configure notification channels to alert the team in case of anomalies.

4.    How would you ensure the security of Kubernetes clusters and applications running within them?

Answer: SREs enforce security best practices, configure RBAC, manage network policies, and use Secrets to store sensitive data securely. Regularly updating Kubernetes and its components with security patches is crucial.

5.  What strategies do you follow to ensure the high availability of applications in Kubernetes?

Answer: SREs use techniques like deploying applications across multiple availability zones, utilizing StatefulSets for stateful applications, and setting up horizontal pod autoscaling to handle varying workloads.

6.   How do you troubleshoot performance issues in a Kubernetes cluster?

Answer: SREs analyze cluster metrics using tools like Prometheus to identify resource bottlenecks. They inspect logs and events, check for overloaded nodes or misconfigured pods, and optimize resource requests and limits.

7.    Explain how you implement disaster recovery for Kubernetes applications and data.

Answer: SREs use backup and restore mechanisms to safeguard critical data. They might employ persistent volumes with backup solutions, create cluster snapshots, and practice disaster recovery drills regularly.

8.   What are the best practices for managing Kubernetes configuration and secrets securely?

Answer: SREs follow the principle of least privilege for access control, use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configurations, and leverage Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive data like passwords and API keys.

9.   How do you handle rolling back a deployment in Kubernetes?

Answer: If an issue arises during a deployment, SREs can revert to the previous version by rolling back the Deployment's pod template to the previous configuration using the kubectl rollout undo command.

10.  What actions would you take if a Kubernetes cluster node becomes unresponsive?

Answer: SREs would first try to SSH into the node and troubleshoot the issue. If unsuccessful, they may drain the node, evicting the running pods and rescheduling them on other healthy nodes. If the problem persists, they might consider rebooting the node or replacing it.

Round 2 questions will be posted in next post!!
